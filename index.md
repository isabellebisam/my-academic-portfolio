### 👩🏻‍💻About Me
Hi! I'm Isabelle, a lawyer with over 20 years of legal experience in the public and private sectors in Brazil. Currently, I combine my legal expertise with interdisciplinary knowledge, bridging law, business strategy, and technology.

In addition to my traditional legal practice, I also focus my career as a research analyst specializing in intellectual property, digital ethics, and AI governance, topics I've been studying for the past five years. My work ranges from machine learning applications in legal contexts to developing policies that protect creators, including research involving the perception and/or use of technological tools, such as AI, by specific populations. 

My goal is to create strategies that comply with current regulations while keeping cultural and social diversity at the core. 

Please feel free to take a look at what I have studied, am studying, and worked on so far.
