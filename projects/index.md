# ðŸ“šResearch Projects

### These are my areas of interests and, below, the projects I've been working on:
- IP literacy
- AI regulation
- Digital ethics
- Creator economy policy

## IP Literacy
### Project Description
IP Literacy is a multidisciplinary research project that investigates how intellectual property (IP) literacy influences the protection practices of small creative entrepreneurs in the Amazon region, particularly in Manaus.
The project examines the intersection between law, education, digital ethics, and innovation policy, seeking to understand how creators engage (or fail to engage) with IP systems in a context marked by cultural richness, technological transformation, and structural inequality.
Through a mixed-methods design â€” combining quantitative surveys, qualitative interviews, and institutional mapping â€” the project aims to:
- identify gaps in knowledge and access to IP protection;
- analyze the ethical, economic, and social implications of digital appropriation;
- propose educational and policy frameworks that promote fair, informed participation in the creative economy.
Ultimately, IP Literacy contributes to the development of inclusive IP education strategies and to the strengthening of the creative and cultural industries in the Amazon.
### Technologies Used
- **Quantitative Analysis:** Excel, SPSS, R, or Python for statistical modeling and data visualization.
- **Qualitative Research:** NVivo or MAXQDA for narrative and content analysis.
- **Survey Tools:** Google Forms, Qualtrics, or LimeSurvey for participant data collection.
- **Institutional Data Sources:** INPI (industrial property), Biblioteca Nacional (copyright), and state or municipal culture registries.
- **Data Visualization & Reporting:** Power BI, Tableau, or Python (Matplotlib, Plotly).
- **Documentation:** Markdown, LaTeX, and GitHub for reproducible academic workflows.

## AI Regulation
### Project Description
AI Regulation is an interdisciplinary research project that explores how national and regional regulatory frameworks shape the creative, economic, and ethical practices of digital creators working with generative AI.
The project investigates jurisdictional divergences in copyright recognition, authorship legitimacy, and transparency requirements across different contexts, such as the United States, European Union, Brazil, and Indonesia. The objective is to understand how these legal variations influence creatorsâ€™ strategies, risks, and access to protection.
Grounded in critical data studies and procedural rhetoric theory, the research examines how regulatory fragmentation functions not only as a source of legal uncertainty but also as a structural force that redistributes opportunities, reproduces inequalities, and fosters informal innovation among creators.
Through comparative analysis of legal texts, policy documents, and creator practices, the project aims to:
- map how generative AI regulation affects creatorsâ€™ ability to claim authorship and monetize their work;
- analyze how transparency, legitimacy, and bias intersect in AI governance systems;
- identify how marginalized or racialized creators navigate regulatory gaps through community norms and platform-based strategies.
Ultimately, AI Regulation contributes to a deeper understanding of how emerging AI policies shape digital cultural production, offering insights for equitable governance and inclusive innovation.
### Technologies Used
- **Legal & Policy Analysis:** Zotero, Mendeley, and Excel for citation management and comparative legal mapping.
- **Qualitative Research:** NVivo or MAXQDA for content and thematic analysis of interviews, policy documents, and platform governance materials.
- **Quantitative & Visualization Tools:** SPSS, R, or Python for cross-country data comparison and statistical modeling.
- **Data Sources:** WIPO Lex, EU AI Act documentation, US Copyright Office policy statements, INPI guidelines, and national legislative portals.
- **Document Management & Workflow:** Markdown, LaTeX, and GitHub for open, reproducible research documentation.
